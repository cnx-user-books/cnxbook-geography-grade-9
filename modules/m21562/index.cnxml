      <title>THE PRODUCTION OF WASTE MATERIALS</title>
      <para id="id23431291">In South Africa, 42 million cubic metres of waste material is generated in a year. The largest portion of this material is produced in Gauteng. The average amount of waste material produced per person per day in South Africa is 0,7kg. The sector that contributes most to this stream of solid waste is the mining industry. They contribute 72,3% of the solid waste material. After this, fuel contributes 6,7% of the solid waste. Agricultural waste contributes 6,1%, while waste from urban areas amounts to 4,5% of the total. Sewerage amounts to 3,6% of the solid waste.</para>
      <para id="id4197091">Such high levels of waste material and pollution are cause for concern. A large amount of the dangerous waste (such as chemical materials) are not treated or disposed of properly. Only 5% of the 5 million cubic metres of chemical waste that is produced eventually reaches the dangerous waste-disposal sites.</para>
